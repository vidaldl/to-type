# Overview
 This is a pretty straightforward To-Do app. You are able to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
 I made everything in JavaScript using TypeScript and its compiler. 

 It was all pretty fun to learn and work on!

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as a code editor, Node and NPM, and TypeScript in this project. I also used HTML and CSS with the bootstrap library for the layout.
